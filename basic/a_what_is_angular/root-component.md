# The selector
The selector: 'app-root' in Angular is a key part of how components are connected to the DOM. It tells Angular where to place the component's template in the DOM when rendering.

What is the selector?

    The selector is a property in the @Component decorator.
    It defines a custom HTML tag that represents the component in the DOM.
    Angular scans the HTML to find elements matching the selector and replaces them with the corresponding component's template.

# How selector: 'app-root' Works

    In the Root Component:
        The root component (typically AppComponent) is declared with selector: 'app-root'.

    Example:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>Welcome to Angular!</h1>`,
})
export class AppComponent {}

In index.html:

    The app-root selector is used as a placeholder in the index.html file.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Angular App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <app-root>Loading...</app-root>
</body>
</html>
Angular identifies the <app-root> element, removes it from the DOM, and replaces it with the compiled output of the AppComponent's template.
